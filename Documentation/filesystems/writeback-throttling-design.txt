writeback throttling design
---------------------------

introduction to dirty throttling
--------------------------------

The write(2) is normally buffered write that creates dirty page cache pages
for holding the data and return immediately. The dirty pages will eventually
be written to disk, or be dropped by unlink()/truncate().

The delayed writeback of dirty pages enables the kernel to optimize the IO:

- turn IO into async ones, which avoids blocking the tasks
- submit IO as a batch for better throughput
- avoid IO at all for temp files

However, there have to be some limits on the number of allowable dirty pages.
Typically applications are able to dirty pages more quickly than storage
devices can write them. When approaching the dirty limits, the dirtier tasks
will be throttled (put to brief sleeps from time to time) by
balance_dirty_pages() in order to balance the dirty speed and writeback speed.

dirty limits
------------

The dirty limit defaults to 20% reclaimable memory, and can be tuned via one of
the following sysctl interfaces:

	/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
	/proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes

The ultimate goal of balance_dirty_pages() is to keep the global dirty pages
under control.

	dirty_limit = dirty_ratio * free_reclaimable_pages

However a global threshold may create deadlock for stacked BDIs (loop, FUSE and
local NFS mounts). When A writes to B, and A generates enough dirty pages to
get throttled, B will never start writeback until the dirty pages go away.

Another problem is inter device starvation. When there are concurrent writes to
a slow device and a fast one, the latter may well be starved due to unnecessary
throttling on its dirtier tasks, leading to big IO performance drop.

The solution is to split the global dirty limit into per-bdi limits among all
the backing devices and scale writeback cache per backing device, proportional
to its writeout speed.

	bdi_dirty_limit = bdi_weight * dirty_limit

where bdi_weight (ranging from 0 to 1) reflects the recent writeout speed of
the BDI.

We further scale the bdi dirty limit inversly with the task's dirty rate.
This makes heavy writers have a lower dirty limit than the occasional writer,
to prevent a heavy dd from slowing down all other light writers in the system.

	task_dirty_limit = bdi_dirty_limit - task_weight * bdi_dirty_limit/16

pause time
----------

The main task of dirty throttling is to determine when and how long to pause
the current dirtier task.  Basically we want to

- avoid too small pause time (less than 1 jiffy, which burns CPU power)
- avoid too large pause time (more than 100ms, which hurts responsiveness)
- avoid big fluctuations of pause times

To smoothly control the pause time, we do soft throttling in a small region
under task_dirty_limit, starting from

	task_throttle_thresh = task_dirty_limit - task_dirty_limit/16

In fig.1, when bdi_dirty_pages falls into

    [0, La]:    do nothing
    [La, A]:    do soft throttling
    [A, inf]:   do hard throttling

Where hard throttling is to wait until bdi_dirty_pages falls more than
task_dirtied_pages (the pages dirtied by the task since its last throttle
time). It's "hard" because it may end up waiting for long time.

Fig.1 dirty throttling regions
                                              o
                                                o
                                                  o
                                                    o
                                                      o
                                                        o
                                                          o
                                                            o
----------------------------------------------+---------------o----------------|
                                              La              A                T
                no throttle                     soft throttle   hard throttle
  T: bdi_dirty_limit
  A: task_dirty_limit      = T - task_weight * T/16
  La: task_throttle_thresh = A - A/16

Soft dirty throttling is to pause the dirtier task for J:pause_time jiffies on
every N:task_dirtied_pages pages it dirtied.  Let's call (N/J) the "throttle
bandwidth". It is computed by the following formula:

                                     task_dirty_limit - bdi_dirty_pages
throttle_bandwidth = bdi_bandwidth * ----------------------------------
                                           task_dirty_limit/16

where bdi_bandwidth is the BDI's estimated write speed.

Given the throttle_bandwidth for a task, we select a suitable N, so that when
the task dirties so much pages, it enters balance_dirty_pages() to sleep for
roughly J jiffies. N is adaptive to storage and task write speeds, so that the
task always get suitable (not too long or small) pause time.

dynamics
--------

When there is one heavy dirtier, bdi_dirty_pages will keep growing until
exceeding the low threshold of the task's soft throttling region [La, A].
At which point (La) the task will be controlled under speed
throttle_bandwidth=bdi_bandwidth (fig.2) and remain stable there.

Fig.2 one heavy dirtier

    throttle_bandwidth ~= bdi_bandwidth  =>   o
                                              | o
                                              |   o
                                              |     o
                                              |       o
                                              |         o
                                              |           o
                                            La|             o
----------------------------------------------+---------------o----------------|
                                              R               A                T
  R: bdi_dirty_pages ~= La

When there comes a new dd task B, task_weight_B will gradually grow from 0 to
50% while task_weight_A will decrease from 100% to 50%.  When task_weight_B is
still small, B is considered a light dirtier and is allowed to dirty pages much
faster than the bdi write bandwidth. In fact initially it won't be throttled at
all when R < Lb where Lb = B - B/16 and B ~= T.

Fig.3 an old dd (A) + a newly started dd (B)

                      throttle bandwidth  =>    *
                                                | *
                                                |   *
                                                |     *
                                                |       *
                                                |         *
                                                |           *
                                                |             *
                      throttle bandwidth  =>    o               *
                                                | o               *
                                                |   o               *
                                                |     o               *
                                                |       o               *
                                                |         o               *
                                                |           o               *
------------------------------------------------+-------------o---------------*|
                                                R             A               BT

So R:bdi_dirty_pages will grow large. As task_weight_A and task_weight_B
converge to 50%, the points A, B will go towards each other (fig.4) and
eventually coincide with each other. R will stabilize around A-A/32 where
A=B=T-0.5*T/16.  throttle_bandwidth will stabilize around bdi_bandwidth/2.

Note that the application "think+dirty time" is ignored for simplicity in the
above discussions. With non-zero user space think time, the balance point will
slightly drift and not a big deal otherwise.

Fig.4 the two dd's converging to the same bandwidth

                                                         |
                                 throttle bandwidth  =>  *
                                                         | *
                                 throttle bandwidth  =>  o   *
                                                         | o   *
                                                         |   o   *
                                                         |     o   *
                                                         |       o   *
                                                         |         o   *
---------------------------------------------------------+-----------o---*-----|
                                                         R           A   B     T

There won't be big oscillations between A and B, because as soon as A coincides
with B, their throttle_bandwidth and hence dirty speed will be equal, A's
weight will stop decreasing and B's weight will stop growing, so the two points
won't keep moving and cross each other.

Sure there are always oscillations of bdi_dirty_pages as long as the dirtier
task alternatively do dirty and pause. But it will be bounded. When there is 1
heavy dirtier, the error bound will be (pause_time * bdi_bandwidth). When there
are 2 heavy dirtiers, the max error is 2 * (pause_time * bdi_bandwidth/2),
which remains the same as 1 dirtier case (given the same pause time). In fact
the more dirtier tasks, the less errors will be, since the dirtier tasks are
not likely going to sleep at the same time.
